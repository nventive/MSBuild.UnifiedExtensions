# nventive.Nimue.Packaging
A set of MSBuild targets aiming at unifying the way package output paths are handled. When installed, this package provides a unified way of setting the output path for the packages generated by a cross-platform application (Xamarin iOS, Xamarin Android, UAP or WebAssembly).

## How to use it?
1. Install the NuGet package in the relevant projects
1. Set the `PackageOutputPath` property
1. Build your projects

*Remark*: the `PackageOutputPath` can be set either in the project itself or passed through the MSBuild parameters (for example, in a Continous Integration context).
