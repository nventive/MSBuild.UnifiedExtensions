# nventive.Nimue.ApplicationPackaging
A set of MSBuild targets aiming at unifying the way package output paths are handled for application projects.

## Why would I use it?
When installed, this package provides a single way of setting the output path for the packages generated by a Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, UAP or WebAssembly application project.
To make it even easier, the variable used for this purpose is [the one used when creating NuGet packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/csproj#packageoutputpath).

## How to use it?
Simply install the NuGet package in the your UAP, Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS application projects. Once there, there's several options:

*Note: This feature is disaled when building in Visual Studio*

### Project level
In the csproj file, add the following:
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PackageOutputPath>$(SolutionDir)\Packages\</PackageOutputPath>
</PropertyGroup>
```
This will cause all the packages to be placed in a `Packages` folder in the folder where the solution is located.

*Note: The path can be set to any value*

### Command line
When building the solution with the MSBuild command line, use the following:
```cmd
msbuild.exe [...] /p:PackageOutputPath=C:\Packages\
```

### Azure Pipelines YAML
When building the solution with Azure Pipelines, `PackageOutputPath` is automatically set to `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`, which is the standard location to place build artifacts. The path can also be set like so
```yml
variables:
- name: PackageOutputPath
  value: C:\Packages\
```
